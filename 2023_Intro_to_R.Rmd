#What is this .Rmd file?

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Note: my RStudio font has font ligatures enabled so typing < and - sequentially automatically combines and displays as a combined arrow <-. You can change any appearances in RStudio by going to the RStudio menu bar. Go to Tools -> Global Options -> Appearance.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

## Tour of RStudio

You can see the "data" and "values" in the upper right hand side under "Environment" tab so you can see what's going on. Instead of having to rely on faulty memory, you'll have a history tab as well. There are tutorials too! Lower right hand side, you'll see your local files and
the help panel.

## Shortcuts in RStudio

If you navigate to the RStudio menu bar at the top of your machine,
under "Tools" -> "Keyboard Shortcuts Help" you will see a list of all
the shortcuts available for you to use. Other Mac & Windows shortcuts
can be found here:
<https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200711853-Keyboard-Shortcuts>

Here are a few that are most commonly used.

### Code Blocks

You can use the keyboard shortcut *Command+Option+I* for Macs and Ctrl+Alt+I
for Windows to start a new code block (see below). These are nice little
chunks of code to help organize your script.

```{r}
3+3
```


### Run Code Blocks

*Command+Shift+Return* -- use this shortcut to run the entire block or click on the green right-facing arrow button on the top right corner of the block to run the entire block. You can run the whole block and the answers will appear right below the code block and at the bottom pane in the "Console".

```{r}
3+3
2-1
3+9
```

### Run Code Lines

*Command+Return* -- will run one line of code in your code block.
*Ctrl+A* -- will move your cursor to the beginning of code line.

For specific lines of code, I recommend highlighting the line of code and using Command+Return to run the highlighted code, rather than the entire block. This shortcut will be especially useful for debugging.

```{r}
3 + 3
2 - 1
3 + 9

```

If you go to the upper right hand side of this pane with the script
you'll see a "Run" button. Sometimes, you'll take a step away from your
computer and you want to run all the code up until the point where you
left it and if your later code relies on your prior code (e.g. variables
were assigned), then you need to run the code up above the section where
you stopped. So use that to make your life easier.

### Comments

Manually type pound signs ## to insert comments. Pound signs ## at the
beginning of the line automatically turn the rest of the line into a
comment.

## Mathematical operations 
R is a Calculator! Basic math operations can be written into a code block and run together or separately.

```{r}
#this is multiplication or this is math
3 * 5 - (4 / 2)
4 - 3 
```
####Range, ascending

```{r}
100:110
```

####Range, descending

```{r}
200:190

```

####Repeats

```{r}
rep(0, 10)
?rep
```


#Variables in R

Variables are essentially names we give to objects. We can store numbers and values, as well as other types of data objects such as vectors, in a variable. You can name these variables whatever you want (usually words or letters) and assign them to hold these objects. In R, both \<- and = can be used interchangeably for assignment in most scenarios, but R purists advocate \<- for assignment. 

```{r}
a1 <- 1 + 2
a2 <- 20 - 3
a3 <- "child"
apple <- 10 + 10

a1 + a2

typeof(a1)
typeof(a2)

class(a1)
class(a2)

a2
a3
apple

a2 + a3

b1 <- TRUE
b1

```

Not all combinations of words or letters can be assigned as variables. There are requirements for variable names that are considered valid: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/r/r_variables.htm

# Data Type

Since R considers everything like variables as an "object", there is a Data Type and Storage Type of each object. 

Data Type refers to the type of object. *typeof()*  will return the data type of a variable.
 https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/typeof.html

Storage Type refers to the internal storage of the object. *mode()* will return the storage mode of a variable.
https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/mode.html

Class determines how generic functions may operate with a variable. You can determine the class of a variable and you can also change the class of certain variables (more on that later). *class()* will return the class of the variable. 

Here are some common data types:

*"numeric"* -- a class describing numeric values. Numeric variables are double by default.

*double* -- a numeric storage type where values are stored as a decimal numbers (i.e. double-precision floating point). 

*"integer"* -- a numeric data type where values are whole numbers (this class has an "integer" storage type).

*"character"* -- data type that describes single digit values such as "a" or "z". What we commonly refer to as "strings" (e.g. "blue","cat") are collections of multiple characters. Strings have a character data type.

*"logical"* -- data type commonly refered to as boolean or TRUE/FALSE variables. Logical variables have a "logical" storage type. 

```{r}
my.numeric <- 42
my.integer <- 42L
my.char <- "universe"
my.logical <- FALSE

typeof(my.numeric)
typeof(my.integer)
typeof(my.char)
typeof(my.logical)

mode(my.numeric)
mode(my.integer)
mode(my.char)
mode(my.logical)

class(my.numeric)
class(my.integer)
class(my.char)
class(my.logical)
```

Notice they're almost the same output. There are a lot of commonalities between the class, data type, and storage type of a variable. That doesn't mean they're the same thing. 

It is really important to know the class associated with each variable when you're debugging. It's a good habit to check the class when you're  trying to figure out why R is throwing you errors. It's also good to know your variable classes because R may not be telling you certain errors. The program is trying to be helpful and handling your data on the back end, coercing certain variables and treating them like other classes. You can be left unawares of the errors and aaaaaaaaall the consequences and downstream effects.

# Data Structures

Data structures are objects in R that we can manipulate (e.g. make calculations with) and organize our data. Data structures in R include vectors, lists, matrices, data frames, and factors.Data types that allowed within each data structure vary according to the data structure.

*Data Structure*, Dimension, Function, Data Type

*vector*, 1, c(), must the same data type
*matrix*, 2,	matrix(), must the same data type
*array*, n,	array(), must the same data type
(we're probably not going to use *matrix* or *array* in this class)

*"factor"*, "levels", factor(), string or integer 

*list*, 1, list(), any data type
*data frame*, 2, data.frame(), any data type

# Vectors
In R, a vector is a sequence of elements with the same data type. We are combining elements and storing them in a vector (hence the "c" in the code). You can assign that vector to a variable and "call it" to work with the values in the vector. Elements must be the same data type!

```{r}
c(1.1, 2.1, 3.1)
orange <- c(1.1, 2.1, 3.1)
orange

class(orange)
typeof(orange)
```

```{r}
c("J", "cat", "dog")
strawberry <- c("J", "cat", "dog")
strawberry

class(strawberry)
typeof(strawberry)
```

Repeats with a vector

```{r}
rep(c(1, 2, 3), 5)
```

Accessing vectors by index uses [] and the first element starts at 1,
not 0!

```{r}
vector <- rep(c(7, 8, 9), 10)
vector
vector[1]
```

Accessing the first three items

```{r}
vector <- rep(c(7, 8, 9), 10)
vector[1:3]
```

Useful functions for vectors

```{r}
x <- c(6, 9, 3, 1, 12, 4, 11, 16, 17, 23, 4)
length(x)              # length of x
mean(x)                # mean
sd(x)                  # standard deviation
var(x)                 # variance
max(x)                 # max
min(x)                 # minimum
```

Subsetting vectors...will come in handy when working with data frames (another )

```{r}
x <- 1:6
x > 3
x[x > 3]
```

Also, note that the period "." has no functional role and is often used
within function and variable names. You will find many example
code/packages that retain this convention, which can be confusing for
users coming from other programming languages where a period might
denote a property or subclass.

```{r}
x.number <- 5
# is equivalent to
x_number <- 5 
# i.e. just a naming convention
names_people
names_places
names.people

```

So let's consider bringing it all together. We have data types, data structures, and object classes. We can create vectors with multiple elements of the same data type. So the vector can contain either numeric data type, character and logical values and you can assign the vector to a variable. Remember, vectors can only have on data type.

```{r}
numeric.vector = c(1,2,3,4)
char.vector = c("a", "b", "c", "d")
logical.vector = c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)

class(numeric.vector)
class(char.vector)
class(logical.vector)

typeof(numeric.vector)
typeof(char.vector)
typeof(logical.vector)
```


# Factors

"Factors" are data structures that take on a limited number of values (i.e.
categorical variables like "Male" or "Female"). A factor variable is stored as a vector of integers so it has an "integer" storage type but with corresponding character values. 

Factors have "levels", which are the options for that variable (i.e. the possible categories). Again, one of the most common situations you will find factors useful are when you are dealing with variables like "gender" in survey data. See https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~s133/factors.html

```{r}
x <- c(1:3, 3:1)
x
?factor()
x <- factor(x, levels = c(1:3), labels = c("gold", "silver", "bronze")) # add levels to the variable
x

class(x)
typeof(x)
```

You can't do math on factors

```{r}
mean(x)
```

You can convert your factor to a numeric or string variable, referring
to the integer codes and labels respectively.

```{r}
?as.numeric
x_num <- as.numeric(x)
is.numeric(x_num)
x_char <- as.character(x)
class(x_char)
```

Additional examples. Note how "factor" has converted the original
numeric values to integer codes, since factor variables are stored as
integers. The new integer codes are different from the original numeric
values.

```{r}
x <- c(2,3,4,5,2)
x <- factor(x, levels = 2:5, labels=c("blue", "white", "green", "red"))
as.numeric(x)
```

Mini-exercise 1. Add some text and create code snippets (Ctrl Option I)
in the markdown document. It's good practice to properly document what
you're doing so future you can figure out what past you was trying to
do. (Important for debugging!) 2. Try creating a numeric vector of size
30, of (1, 2, 3) repeated 10 times in one of the code snippets you
create. Create a character and logical vector while you're at it. Assign
the vectors to some variable. 3. Find type and class of different
variables you created. 4. Run your code snippets within your .Rmd
document with Ctrl+Shift+Enter 3. Try knitting your modified .Rmd file
to html


#Lists

Lists vs. vectors - vectors have to be all of the same data type,
whereas lists can have different data types.

```{r}
sample.list <- list(18, "f", TRUE)
sample.vector <- c(18, "f", TRUE)


```

To access a single element in a list, it's better to use [[]] than [],
because list[] returns another list. So you can use [[i]] to access the
ith in the list.

Note that the vector converted 18 (and all other elements) to a
character data type on its own. Check the data type of the sample.vector
using code and in the environment pane on the upper right hand side too.

```{r}
sample.list[[1]]
sample.vector[1]


```

Elements in a list can also be named

```{r}
prof <- list(height = 180,            
            name = "Coye",
            rabbits = 5,
            favorite.number = 3.14,
            employed = TRUE)

prof

```

You can still use the numbers to access elements, but you can also use
\$ for column names

```{r}
prof$rabbits
```

Lists can also contain lists within them

```{r}
prof_details = list(height = 180,            
            name = "Coye",
            rabbits = 3,
            favorite.number = 3.14,
            employed = TRUE,
            courses.taught = list(
                list(
                    name = "quantitative methods",
                    course.id = "i271b"
                ),
                list(
                    name = "underwater basket weaving",
                    course.id = "i203"
                )
            )
        )
```

Mini-exercise 1. Within a new block (Ctrl Option I), try to print out
the course.id of quantitative methods class by daisy chaining
name/square bracket operators 2. Find the type and class of different
pieces of the prof data variable


# DataFrames 

Data frames are lists of variables with same number of rows. It's a list of vectors, where each vector (column) is the same length. We'll be using Data Frames a lot. Since we're working with rows and columns, data frames are going to feel similar to spreadsheet or pandas dataframes. 

```{r}
emp.data <- data.frame(
   emp_id = c(741, 882, 293, 410, 312), 
   emp_name = c("Ryan","Dan","Michelle","Sarah","Gary"),
   salary = c(623.3,515.2,611.0,729.0,526.5),
   department = c("HR", "Not Applicable", "Marketing", "Engineering", "Marketing"),
   hours_worked = c(40, 45, 10, -99, 15), 
   stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

class(emp.data)
typeof(emp.data)
mode(emp.data) #R stores data frames as lists
```

The head() function lets you look at the first five rows. tail() from
the bottom up.

```{r}
head(emp.data)
```

The str() function is also useful - it tells you the structure of your
dataset (rows/columns), plus more info about each column. Similar to
.info() in pandas.

```{r}
str(emp.data)
dim(emp.data)
```

Since data frames are lists, you can access a specific column with the
\$. It's the same as [[]]. In the rest of this tutorial, you'll see way
we access columns using \$ quite often.

```{r}
emp.data$salary

```

To subset, you can use the approach from earlier - specify the vector
and then subset that, or a different approach where the first argument
is the row and the second is the column

```{r}
emp.data$emp_name[3]
emp.data[3, "emp_name"]

```

When dealing with variables, it is super helpful to use the "Tab" key.
There will be a list of variables that can "autocomplete" your code. For
example, after you start writing a variable name, you can click tab to
see the column name options in the data frame.

```{r}
emp.data$emp_name[3]
emp.data$emp_name[3]
```

Following the second approach of selecting rows/columns, if you want
multiple rows or columns, you can pass more than one number in

```{r}
emp.data[c(1, 2, 3), c("emp_name", "salary")]
```

Very important - you can filter rows based on the values in a column.
The first argument inside the brackets is the condition and after the
comma, you list the columns you want. Listing nothing selects all
columns.

```{r}
emp.data[emp.data$salary > 600, ]
```

You can also include functions like mean() as part of your filtering

```{r}
emp.data[emp.data$salary < mean(emp.data$salary), ]
mean(emp.data$salary)

```

The summary() function is another useful one. Below, I called it on one
column.

```{r}
summary(emp.data$salary)
```

R comes with many preloaded datasets you can play around with. data()
brings up the list of datasets. In our mini-assignment, we'll be working
with the iris dataset. Let's check it out.

```{r}
head(iris)

```

Looking at the structure

```{r}
str(iris)
summary(iris)
```


# Missing values + Dataframes
Read carefully!

Missing/unusable data can take many forms. Sometimes, they are stored as
blank entries, or may have a special code assigned to them. In looking
over your data and meta-data, you may also decide to recode some data as
NA values. Finally, various R functions may coerce values to NA in your
dataframe.

In summary, you should: 1. Think about your analysis and make sure
variables are correctly coded to NA. For instance, if -99 refers to no
response when you get your survey responses through qualtrics, you
should code it to NA if you are interested in calculating the mean value
for only the people who responded. 

2. If you are using an R function for
analysis, etc, mean(), check if the function used has a na.rm=TRUE
argument in the help file (?mean etc.). Make sure to set the argument to
true if it does. 

3. In some analyses we will discuss later, you may want
to drop all rows with missing values in any of the columns (code to do
so will be covered later in this video). Dropping rows may not be
appropriate for some analyses, as you might lose too much data.

## Recoding variables in DFs
Returning to our emp.data dataframe, let's go through the steps to
recode any missing values as NA.

First, let's take a peek at our data again:

```{r}
#You can just refresh your memory on the column names and right away if you can see the potential "missing" values. Think about which rows should be considered missing data.
head(emp.data)
```

But the potential missing values not always going to be at the top of the dataset. You can use the table function to quickly tabulate the existing values to check for codes that might refer to missing values. 

```{r}
table(emp.data$department)
# There should be 5 total values for 5 rows, but the row values say otherwise

table(emp.data$hours_worked)
```

There should be 5 total values for 5 rows, but the numeric row value say otherwise

You'll notice that under hours_worked, Sarah has "-99" coded, and under department, Dan has "Not Applicable."

If we took the mean of hours_worked, obviously we would get an
artifically low value. But it's not always obvious if that would be the
case especially with larger datasets. This low value would still occur
even if we applied na.rm=TRUE, which removes any values that have been
coded as NA.

```{r}

mean(emp.data$hours_worked)
mean(emp.data$hours_worked, na.rm=TRUE)

```

Logical checks are very important! If the average hours worked seem off
to you based on what you would expect to see in the data, or based on
the headers, or just how you collected and examined the dataset, make
sure you check to avoid downstream and carryover errors. (Remember,
there is no answer key in real life research design!)

### How to recode as NA

We have to get into the weeds, which is why it's important to really
understand the ins and outs of the data you will be collecting and
working with.

We have to recode the appropriate row and column as NA, i.e.

```{r}
emp.data[emp.data$hours_worked==-99, "hours_worked"] <- NA 
emp.data
```

Now, applying mean gives different values. Without setting the argument na.rm=TRUE, the mean function returns NA as an end result - a precaution the function takes to make sure you are aware of missing values. 

```{r}
mean(emp.data$hours_worked)
mean(emp.data$hours_worked, na.rm=TRUE)
```

Let's do the same and recode Dan's department of "Not applicable". 

```{r}
emp.data[emp.data$department=="Not Applicable", "department"] <- NA 
emp.data

#check to see everything is nice and clean and it worked
table(emp.data$department)

table(emp.data$hours_worked)
```

### How to ignore NAs in calculations

Now, say we want the mean salary ONLY for employees with non-missing hours worked. How would we do this?

```{r}
salary_non_missing_hours = emp.data[!is.na(emp.data$hours_worked), "salary"]
emp.data
```

Comparing, we can see the returned vector excludes Sarah's salary of 729, because her hours_worked variable is missing.

```{r}
# We can then pass the vector to the mean function. 
mean(salary_non_missing_hours)
mean(salary_non_missing_hours, na.rm=TRUE) # no difference since there are no missing values
```

Now, say we want the salary (not just the mean) ONLY for employees with no missing data in ANY of the variables. We can use the na.omit function. 

```{r}
only.complete.emp.data = na.omit(emp.data)
only.complete.emp.data
emp.data
```
Comparing, you can see how the entire row for Dan and Sarah have been removed. Some analyses will require complete data, such as where we compare nested regression models, which we will discuss more later.
 
### How to recode to create variables in DFs

We've already discussed how we might recode specific values where they
are missing values. Here, I look at how we can recode variables to
create new variables that we might need for different analyses.

```{r}
head(emp.data)
```

For most recodes, I strongly encourage the following approach:

Say you'll like to create a new variable that categorizes salary into
"Low", "Medium" and "High".

First, recall the importance of understanding the class and type of your
variables. Since salary is a numeric variable, your row condition uses
numbers - e.g. 700 and 600. If you are using a character variable as a
row condition, you would use characters - we will go through an example
of this below.

```{r}
emp.data$salary_cat = NA
 
emp.data$salary_cat[emp.data$salary>700] = "High"
emp.data$salary_cat[emp.data$salary<=700 &emp.data$salary>600] = "Medium"
emp.data$salary_cat[emp.data$salary<=600] = "Low"
 
#You can use "table" to check that the counts in your recoded variable correspond to what you expect, and "head" to print out values side by side to make sure the recode has been done correctly.
table(emp.data$salary)
table(emp.data$salary_cat)
head(emp.data[, c('salary', 'salary_cat')], 50)
```

Some functions will require a factor variable. For those, you can
convert a character variable to a factor variable as easily as follows:

```{r}
emp.data$fact_cat = factor(emp.data$salary_cat)

# You can perform various checks to make sure the code is doing what you expect. 
class(emp.data$fact_cat)
class(emp.data$salary_cat)
 
table(emp.data$salary_cat)
table(emp.data$fact_cat)
levels(emp.data$fact_cat)
 
head(emp.data[, c('fact_cat', 'salary_cat')], 50)

```

Say, you want to find the mean hours worked for employees with a
"Medium" salary.

If we are using salary_cat, which is a character variable, as a row
condition, we need to add quotation marks to the condition as shown
below (as opposed to, for instance, a numeric variable where we would
use numbers).

```{r}
#easiest way to understand R code is to read it out loud in the following way:
#in the datafram emp.data [], for the rows that have "medium" in the column emp.data$salary_cat =="Medium", give me the hours worked
emp.data[emp.data$salary_cat =="Medium", "hours_worked"]
emp.data
```

Try it: what happens when you change Medium to High? to Low? What's the mean of the hours worked? (mean of 40 and 10. Verify it's true for yourself.)

```{r}
mean(emp.data[emp.data$salary_cat =="Medium", "hours_worked"])
```

Note, you must always supply the second argument when selecting a subset of a dataframe, i.e. you need the comma, even if the argument is blank after, which selects all t-he columns. See below for what to do and not to do:

```{r}
emp.data[emp.data$salary_cat =="Medium", ]

# DO NOT DO THIS - you will get unexpected and imprecise results and outputs
emp.data[emp.data$salary_cat == "Medium" ] 

# DO THIS 
emp.data[emp.data$salary_cat == "Medium", ] # or
emp.data[emp.data$salary_cat == "Medium", "hours_worked"]

```

A common command for simple recodes is ifelse. But NEVER use this for
more than 2 categories, and make sure you've coded NAs correctly. While
you can technically nest multiple ifelse functions, that makes for
extremely poor readability and increases the likelihood of recode
errors.

I recommend using the first method (recording values) and not ifelse for
more complicated recodes.

```{r}
emp.data$above_600 = ifelse(emp.data$salary > 600, "Above 600", "Not above 600")
emp.data
```

###How to convert Data Types in DFs

Finally, you can also use as.numeric function to ask R to try to convert
a variable to a numeric type, or as.character to ask R to try to convert
a variable to a character type. These commands are often useful, for
instance, if a numeric variable has been incorrectly read by R as a
character variable due to the inclusion of character codes such as
"Don't know" or "No data" in a particular column.

You can ask R for help regarding these commands by typing in ?as.numeric
or ?as.character or ?as.integer into the console or in the code block.
On the lower right hand pane, you will see the "Help" pane open up with
information specifically about the command you need help with or need
more details about. The Help pane is SUPER useful for debugging.

```{r}
?as.integer
```

To show how this works as an example, let's create a new column in emp.data with some hypothetical data.

```{r}
emp.data$tenure = c(10, 5, 6, "Don't know", 3)
emp.data
```

Notice that since we use the c generic function, the class and type of emp.data$tenure has been coerced to character, because of the "Don't know" value.


```{r}
class(emp.data$tenure)
typeof(emp.data$tenure)
```

Let's now replace "Don't know" with NA. 
```{r}
emp.data[emp.data$tenure=="Don't know", "tenure"] = NA
emp.data
```

But our class is still character, but we want numeric. We can simply do:

```{r}
emp.data$numeric_tenure = as.numeric(emp.data$tenure)
emp.data[, c('tenure', 'numeric_tenure')]
```

Side by side, you can see the conversion has been done correctly. 

If you are confident of what your code is doing, or have checked it, you can then replace tenure directly as a numeric variable.

```{r}
emp.data$tenure = as.numeric(emp.data$tenure)
emp.data

class(emp.data$tenure)

typeof(emp.data$tenure)

# You can see now emp.data$tenure has a numeric class and double type, which is what we want. 

# To tidy up, let's delete our numeric_tenure variable.
emp.data$numeric_tenure <- NULL
emp.data
```

# Loading packages and data into R

##Loading packages
If a package is not already installed in your R environment, first
install it, then load it in (similar to "import" in python)

Make sure to comment out or delete the install.packages line when
knitting, otherwise it will throw an error. You only need to run
install.packages once.

```{r}
# Comment out to avoid throwing error when knitting to html 
# install.packages("ggplot2")
library("ggplot2")
```

## Loading data

### Loading CSVs

CSVs are files where data is separated by commas (comma separated
values). Working directories are essentially folders in your computer
where you have stored files.

Loading CSV's: You can either keep all your CSV files in the default
working directory (usually the R project folder you downloaded from
bcourses), or you can set the working directory to whatever folder you
want and then load it into R that way. Just make sure you know where
your directories are. Trying to set or get working directories that
don't exist and/or asking R to retrieve files that are not there will
throw errors.

```{r}
getwd()
setwd("~/Documents/Intro_to_R")
list.files()
```

With read.csv() we're essentially importing the CSV file into R.

```{r}
setwd("~/Documents/Intro_to_R")
quakes <- read.csv("quakes.csv")
```

Notice that quakes as a variable is now in your environment on the right side pane of R. Let's check how it was imported:
  
```{r}
class(quakes)
```

### Loading Tables

read.table() is the primary function you'll be using to read various
delimiter-separated text files (e.g. commas, semicolons). We use
read.table() because not all our files will be specifically comma
delimited. read.csv() is just read.table() with specific options
outlined (see ?read.csv and compare to ?read.table). Some args:

-header, which tells the function to interpret the first line as a list
of column names. FALSE by default so set it to TRUE here. -sep, for
separator. By default, the function will split the data based on any
whitespace it detects. Depending on your data, you'll most likely want
to set an explicit separator, such as sep="\t" for tab or sep="," for
comma. -na.strings for specifying what strings should be interpreted as
a missing value. So, if your data file happens to use . and -999 as
missing values, you can pass na.strings=c("-999", "."). c("NA") by
default.

Simple example

```{r}
setwd("~/Documents/Intro_to_R")
goog <- read.table(
    "goog-daily.txt", 
    header=TRUE, 
    sep=","
)
```

Complicated example

```{r}
setwd("~/Documents/Intro_to_R")
berkeley.temperature <- read.table(
    "37.78N-122.03W-TAVG-Trend.txt", 
    blank.lines.skip=TRUE,       # ignores blank lines
    comment="%",              # removes lines commented out with a %
    na.strings="NaN"          # changes 'NaN' in .txt file to NA in data frame
    ) 

#Let's see how to break this down with the help that R provides.
?read.table()

```

```{r}
head(berkeley.temperature)
```

The column names weren't read properly, so we can manually adjust those
ourselves. For example:

```{r}
colnames(berkeley.temperature)[1] <- 'year'
colnames(berkeley.temperature)
```

```{r}
head(berkeley.temperature)
```



# Plotting charts

Plotting charts in R can be intuitive depending on the specific function
used. This section gives you just enough code to try out some functions
for yourself.

We will revisit plotting functions later in the semester, but you may
often find plotting diagrams to be a combination of looking up example
code online, and trial and error.

For some examples, see: <https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/>
<https://www.statmethods.net/advgraphs/ggplot2.html>

For a more in-depth introduction:
<https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ggplot2/versions/3.3.2>

Pulling in ggplot2

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

Plotting a histogram

```{r}
f <- ggplot(iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length))
f + geom_histogram()
```

R gave us a warning about the bin width above, so we can set a different
one

```{r}
f + geom_histogram(binwidth=0.5) 
```

Adding some color

```{r}
f + geom_histogram(binwidth=0.5, color="white", fill="purple")
```

Adding a label on the x-axis

```{r}
f + geom_histogram(binwidth=0.5, color="white", fill="purple") + labs(x="Iris Sepal Length")
```

If we wanted to add a second variable, we can create an x and y axis.
Other plots that could be useful: geom_point, geom_jitter, geom_area,
geom_density, geom_dotplot, geom_bar

```{r}
f <- ggplot(iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=Sepal.Width))
f + geom_point()
```
